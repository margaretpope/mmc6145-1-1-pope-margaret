            <p className={styles.p}>I am a student at the University of Florida, pursuing a master's degree in mass communication. I expect to graduate in May 2025. </p>
            <p className={styles.p}>I graduated from the University of Mississippi in May 2016 with a degree in history and went on to work for a small organization called Mockingbird Ministries in Charlottesville, Virginia. I served as Mockingbird's administrator and oversaw many of the details for organizing our annual conference in New York City.</p>
            <p className={styles.p}>For the last five years, I have worked as the communications coordinator at the Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama, where I have been responsible for managing our Instagram accounts, as well as updating and maintaining our website. I look forward to seeing where my on-the-job training, coupled with my master's degree, can take my career.</p>
